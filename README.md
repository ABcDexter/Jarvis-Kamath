#Bot Kamath

Basically I took shpotify and the facebook-chat-api npm package and turned Facebook Messenger into an ssh client. All you need to do is clone the repo, change your email and password in index.js, then run 

"npm install && node index.js" 

and you should be golden

I used [shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/archive/master.zip) and [facebook-chat-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/facebook-chat-api)

##THE SPOTIFY STUFF ONLY WORKS ON MAC
